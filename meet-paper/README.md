# Meet Paper Theme

This block-based theme provides a modern starting point for WordPress sites. It demonstrates optional Web3 integrations using a "Connect Wallet" pattern and customizable global styles defined in `theme.json`.

The theme ships with a comprehensive set of typography scales, layout controls and color palettes. A built-in dark style variation lets visitors switch to a low-contrast experience.

## Patterns

- **Hero banner** – introductory header area.
- **Connect Wallet** – premium section encouraging visitors to link a blockchain wallet.

To install, copy the `meet-paper` directory into your `wp-content/themes` folder and activate it from the WordPress dashboard.
